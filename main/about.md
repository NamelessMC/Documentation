## Plugin
For Minecraft integration, you can install the Nameless Plugin in your Spigot server. Currently the plugin is only available for spigot, but we're working on bringing it to different server software, such as Sponge and BungeeCord. You can find a list of features and installation instructions in the [plugin readme](https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless-Plugin/blob/master/README.md).
